          My academic journey (video transcript)
        </h3>
        <p class="grey-darken-1--text" style="text-align: justify">
          <strong>As a girl, my dream was to sing</strong>, and being told I
          couldn't do that authentically, just made me sing my heart out. In
          hiding, I recorded five albums. I taught myself how to record and
          produce my own music. And on this quest to find my voice, I became
          fascinated by sound, and by signals. <br /><br />

          On my masters, I met Ata. I knew that her sharp mind would be the
          perfect sounding board for my PhD ideas. Separating voices from
          mixtures is a problem close to the hearts of many a sound engineer. In
          signal processing, we call this the 'cocktail party problem'. There
          are many people at this hypothetical cocktail party and their voices
          overlap. We desire to separate the voices from the recordings, which
          are mixture signals. This problem is blind source separation; blind
          because we don't make many assumptions about the sources.
          <br /><br />

          My PhD explored how we do this when the mixture signals are distorted:
          what assumptions we need to make to separate the signals, and how we
          can constrain and inform the problem by geometric observations about
          the distorted mixtures. I published two papers, and as my thesis
          neared completion, I resolved to complete my research as me. I came
          out gradually as a trans woman in 2018/2019, and since then, I have
          experienced monstrous treatment from all corners of our society.
          <br /><br />

          Undeterred and determined, I have doggedly fought to access the
          gender-affirming healthcare I need. I'm almost back from medical leave
          - a lot longer than expected because surgery did not go to plan. Our
          NHS massively let me down. There's more on this in my website's links.
          <br /><br />

          As I return to my thesis, I find myself pondering the big problems -
          like consciousness. Each conscious entity has an identity. How do we
          know who we are? We each know our own identity, because from birth, we
          are fed a stream of training data. Identities form in the neural
          networks of newborn brains, and they are shaped by interactions with
          other conscious entities. Our society trains us all with a simple
          rule: that there are two gender identities and that the gender
          identity of any given conscious human entity can be known by a
          physical inspection. This is not true.
          <br /><br />

          In reality, gender is (better thought of as) a spectrum. Non-binary
          people exist. In machine learning, we would call this simple rule a
          poor binary classifier. A mind that was trained from an early age with
          the binary classifier will naturally have difficulties grasping this
          fact: this is what we would expect, binary classifiers perform poorly
          on data that does not have discrete classes. For transgender people,
          who are incorrectly classified at birth by society's poor binary
          classifier, this is a big problem; but the poor binary classifier
          holds all of us back from truly understanding our identities, until we
          acknowledge it for what it is.
          <br /><br />

          As someone who was incorrectly classified at birth, this binary
          classifier is darkly close to my heart. As I complete my PhD thesis, I
          have some very exciting ideas developing for future research topics in
          this area. I'm looking forward to pursuing these ideas in the near
          future and I welcome discussions about this.

        <p class="grey-darken-1--text" style="text-align: justify">
          I enjoying speaking, writing and improving my German. I've recently
          started writing my poetry in German, too. When I need to relax, I love
          to make digital art. There are some of my artworks in my website art
          gallery.
