          Music is life: but audio is my first love. It has been my foundation,
          my sanctuary and a source of healing. In my goth subculture teens, I
          produced five of my own albums, rapidly cultivating my interest in
          audio production and digital signal processing. I saw the opportunity
          to combine my love for audio signals with my mathematical background,
          so I set out to pursue a PhD here at UoB. It's been a wild, enriching
          and exciting ride.<br /><br />
          After 2 publications, in 2019, the time had come for me to finish my
          PhD, something I resolved to do as myself. I disclosed the fact I'm
          trans to the University and have since pursued gender-affirming
          healthcare. My physical recovery from major surgery abroad was far
          longer than anticipated due to COVID and complications. I'm nearly
          back from medical leave now, and I can't wait to wrap up my thesis and
          take my next bold strides into the future. <br /><br />
          I am very excited by the notion of applying my data science skills to
          gender-affirming healthcare data and I am seeking projects in this
          field.
