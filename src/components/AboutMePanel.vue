          <strong>I have been on a lifelong quest to rediscover my voice</strong>
          while cultivating a fascination with sound and signals.
          <br /><br />

          Separating voices from mixtures is a problem close to the hearts of
          many an audio engineer. In signal processing, we call this the
          'cocktail party problem'. There are many people at this hypothetical
          cocktail party and their voices overlap. We desire to separate the
          voices from the recordings, which are mixture signals. This problem is
          blind source separation; blind because we don't make many assumptions
          about the sources.
          <br /><br />

          My PhD explored how we do this when the mixture signals are distorted:
          what assumptions we need to make to separate the signals, and how we
          can constrain and inform the problem by geometric observations about
          the distorted mixtures. I published two papers, and as my thesis
          neared completion, the time had come for me to complete my research as
          me. I came out as a trans woman in 2019.
          <br /><br />

          I have recently submitted my PhD thesis. I am excited to find out what
          the world has in store for the next chapter of my life.
